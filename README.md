## dmenu-desktop-go

This is a little program that allows you to launch .desktop files on your system from dmenu and similar programs.
It also supports aliases and exludes through a config and is much better that my previous project [dmenu-desktop-bash](https://github.com/technicfan/dmenu-desktop-bash).

### Info:

It's pretty fast I'd say, but [j4-dmenu-desktop](https://github.com/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop) is still faster.
Like j4-dmenu-desktop, it searches `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` and `$XDG_DATA_HOME` for .desktop files.

### Usage:

Just download the binary or compile it yourself and run it.
All arguments are directly passed to your menu command.
